- We should ignore any trials before 2008
    - [When is reporting required?](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/fdaaa#WhenDoINeedToRegister)
- Studies for a products not approved, licensed, or cleared as of the
primary completion date don't need to have results submitted if they
 completed before January 18, 2017
    - [When do I need to register](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/manage-recs/fdaaa#WhenDoINeedToRegister)
- Currently not clear if delayed submission requests are exposed in the clinicaltrials.gov api
    - Actually, probably the `DelayedPosting` field
